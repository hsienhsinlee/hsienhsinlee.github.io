Cyber exploits and remote attacks on network servers and workstations are becoming serious concerns by both network service providers and Internet users. Due to the deficiency of effective and efficient countermeasures and self-recovery capability, malicious adversaries can easily duplicate a software, modify it, reverse-engineer to reveal its secret, append virus, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This project aims at addressing these emerging issues for high performance networks and computing systems. Our research focus is to investigate the security and recovery issues from the perspective of architecture and system software in a hierarchical manner. The ultimate goal is to provide robust security and non-disruptive service availability transparent to user clients.
<br><br>
First, this project investigates a comprehensive CASC infrastructure called Memory-centric Security Architecture (MESA) that provides and enables security support from OS, platform architecture, and microarchitecture to address the security challenges. Novel features of MESA include memory-centric security management, principle execution, information security monitoring, register labeling, trace obfuscation engine, secure memory controller, and M-TREE microprocessor. While providing robost security support at the system level, their implications toward performance are also being studied.  To satisfy performance requirement for such high performance systems, novel microarchitecture techniques, including counter prediction and precomputation, authentication speculation, frequent cipher prediction, etc., are under investigation. By putting them altogether, the entire MESA system can effectively and efficiently address security, performance and interoperability under a multi-domain information sharing environment and guarantee data privacy and integrity of a shared-memory multiprocessor/multi-core system.
<br><br>
The second thrust of this project investigates  intrusion-tolerant and self-recovery techniques based on a multi-core processor or chip multiprocessor (CMP). Our technique leverages the closely-coupled processors on a chip to perform instant backup, fine-grained security introspection, and fast recovery for corrupted or compromised data. We introduce the concept of security-insulation using differential cores on a CMP to isolate higher privileged jobs from potential external exploits. All service applications running on lower privileged cores, if attacked, will be recovered by the security-insulated core using our high speed checkpointing scheme.  Such a security-enhanced CMP platform provides multi-point defenses and efficient introspection mechanism to tolerate remote exploits and achieve fast recovery, making an autonomic system practical.
<br><br>
The intellectual merits of this project include the following: (a) tackling issues with a hierarchical multifaceted approach from microarchitecture to the operating system in order to achieve secure and autonomic computing, (b)developing techniques for copy protection, data authentication and maintaining software confidentiality under a multi-domain software system and/or a multiprocessor system, (c) developing highly efficient self-recovery autonomic capability with emerging processor platform, (d) demonstrating the performance advantages of our techniques, (e) providing a holistic solution to enabling security and high service availability.
