Overview
</font>
</h5>


3D-MAPS (3D <u>MA</u>ssively <u>P</u>arallel processor with <u>S</u>tacked 
memory) V1 is a logic+memory 2-tier 3D IC, where the logic die consists of 64 
general purpose processor cores running at 277MHz, and the memory die contains 
256KB SRAM. <font color=red> This 3D IC is arguably the FIRST many-core general 
purpose 3D processor developed in academia.</font> This 3D processor achieves up 
to 64GB/s memory bandwidth while consuming 5W power. This project is led by 
<a href='http://users.ece.gatech.edu/limsk/'>Prof. Sung Kyu Lim</a> (PI) and <a href='http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~leehs/'>Prof. Hsien-Hsin Lee</a> (co-PI) from the Georgia 
Institute of Technology and Dr. Gabriel Loh (co-PI) from AMD with funding from 
the US Department of Defense. There have been 20+ students involved in this 
project working on architecture, programming, CAD tools, circuit and physical 
design, packaging, board design, and testing. Our collaborators include KAIST, 
Tezzaron, Amkor Inc, and Board Lab.


<p><img src=team.JPG><p>

<p>The fabrication of this chip is completed in July 2011 using the 130nm 
GlobalFoundies device technology and 1.2um TSV diameter Tezzaron technology. The 
packaging is completed in August 2011 by Amkor. 8 parallel applications are 
developed to demonstrate the bandwidth and power benefit of 3D MAPS processor. 
This processor contains 33M transistors, 50K TSVs, and 50K face-to-face 
connections in 5mm x 5mm footprint and 0.8mm thickness. 

<p>The core architecture is developed from scratch by our architecture team to 
benefit from single-cycle access to SRAM. One of the two instructions we issue 
in one cycle can be memory read/write, so it is possible to access memory at 
every clock cycle. Our RTL-to-GDSII tool chain is based on commercial tools from 
Synopsys, Cadence, and Mentor Graphics. Since these tools can only handle 2D 
ICs, we have developed plug-ins to handle TSVs and 3D stacking.

3D-MAPS V1 supports 42 instructions, and we wrote 8 parallel applications and 
ran them on our chip. Here are the memory bandwidth and power measurement

<p>The theoretical maximum memory bandwidth 3D-MAPS V1 can achieve is 70.9GB/s, 
which is computed by 277MHz x 64 (cores) x 4 Bytes (1 word). One of our 
applications, median filter, got very close to this theoretical value at the 
lowest power consumption. As a comparison, here are the maximum achievable 
bandwidth values of the state-of-the-art processor and memory technology (as of 
Sep 2011):
<ul>
<li> Intel i7 Extreme Edition + Samsung DDR3 1600 MHz = 1600 MHz x 2 ch x 8 
Bytes = 25.6 GB/s
<li> Intel Xeon E7 + Samsung DDR3 1066 MHz = 1066 MHz x 4 ch x 8 Bytes = 34.1 
GB/s
</ul>

3D-MAPS V1 is fabricated in 130nm technology in 5mm x 5mm footprint. If 3D-MAPS 
V1 is fabricated in 45nm in 15mm x 15mm footprint (as in Intel i7), the maximum 
memory bandwidth skyrockets as follows:

<ul>
<li> 277 MHz X 5 (speedup from 45nm) x 64 ch x 9 (more area) x 4 (smaller cores) 
x 4 Bytes = <font color=red>12,764 GB/s</font>
</ul>
This truly demonstrates the enormous memory bandwidth benefit of core+memory 3D 
IC.

<img src=3D-MAPS-V1-fig8.jpg><br>FIGURE 1: This is the stacking information of 
3D-MAPS V1. We use bonding wires and TSVs for the package-to-chip signal and P/G 
delivery. Chip-to-chip communication is done using F2F pads. The bonding wires 
did not break the TSVs underneath during manufacturing. Each IO cell contains 
204 redundant TSVs.<p>

<img src=3D-MAPS-V1-fig1.JPG><br><font color=blue>FIGURE 2: The topside of 
3D-MAPS V1 is actually the backside of the core die that is thinned down to 
12um. With bare eyes, we can only see dummy TSVs and IO cells.<p>

<img src=3D-MAPS-V1-fig3.JPG><br>FIGURE 3: SEM image of Tezzaron TSVs and 
face-to-face bond pads.<p>

pads.<p>

<img src=3D-MAPS-V1-fig4.png><br>FIGURE 5: The above image is obtained using an 
infrared microscope with 6um depth. Since the top surface of 3D-MAPS V1 is the 
thinned substrate of top die, we had to use an IR microscope to reveal the 
circuitry that is buried under this substrate. The white dots are dummy TSVs we 
had to add to satisfy the TSV density rule set by Tezzaron.<p>

single IO cell.<p>

side-by-side.<p>


<img src=3D-MAPS-V1-fig5.JPG><br>FIGURE 8: The open TSV above, fortunately, does 
not cause any problem because all of the TSVs shown are redundant. The top die 
(= core die) is thinned down to 12um, and the bottom die (= memory die) height 
is 765um, making the total thickness to be roughly 0.8mm.<p>
